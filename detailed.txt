🚀 Day 1 of my 100 Days Project Challenge! Today marks the beginning of a journey I’ve been wanting to start for a long time — a 100 Days Project Challenge dedicated to learning, building, and growing every single day. 🌱 For Day 1, I created a Hub Shoes Landing Page using HTML and CSS. 👟💻 This project helped me explore how small design elements — like layout, spacing, color combinations, and responsiveness — can completely transform the user experience. It’s amazing how front-end development allows you to bring even the simplest ideas to life through code and creativity! My main goal through this challenge is to: Strengthen my development and design skills Stay consistent in daily learning Build a strong portfolio of projects And most importantly, enjoy the process of creation! 🎯 This is just the start — 99 more days to go, and I’m super excited to see how much I’ll grow through this journey. I’m truly grateful to my mentor,Dhruv Chaturvedi who has been a constant source of guidance, motivation, and inspiration throughout my learning journey. 🌟 hashtag#100DaysChallenge hashtag#Day1 hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#FrontendDeveloper hashtag#HTML hashtag#CSS hashtag#UIUXDesign hashtag#LearningJourney hashtag#CodeNewbie hashtag#DailyProjects hashtag#GrowthMindset hashtag#KeepBuilding 🚀 Day 2 of my hashtag#100DaysProjectChallenge Today, I built “TipEasy” – a Tip Calculator App 💡 A simple yet practical tool that helps you calculate the perfect tip in seconds — because math shouldn’t come between you and your meal! 🍽️ Through this project, I explored logic building, UI design, and user-friendly functionality — making everyday tasks a little easier through code. 💻 Excited to keep learning, creating, and improving each day! 🌱 Mentored by Dhruv Chaturvedi hashtag#Day2 hashtag#100DaysOfCode hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#UIUX hashtag#HTML hashtag#CSS hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#FrontendDeveloper hashtag#LearningJourney hashtag#TipCalculator hashtag#ProjectBasedLearning 🚀 Day 3 of my hashtag#100DaysOfProject Challenge! Today I built a Unit Converter Dashboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to convert between Temperature, Length, and Weight units easily — and even view saved results and conversion tips! Excited to keep improving my frontend skills every day. ✨ Mentored by Dhruv Chaturvedi sir who guides constantly and motivates me through this challenge hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#Frontend hashtag#LearningJourney 🚀 Day 4 of my hashtag#100DaysOfProject Challenge! Hello everyone, I’m Shakshi, and I’m excited to share my project; the Weather-Based Quote webpage This is a simple yet creative webpage built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The concept is that users can select a weather type such as sunny, rainy, or cloudy, and the app instantly displays a motivational quote that matches the selected mood. The background color of the page also changes dynamically based on the chosen weather, making it visually interactive and user-friendly. Through this project, I learned how to handle user input, use arrays and objects in JavaScript, and update the webpage dynamically while maintaining a clean and minimal design. It was a great learning experience that helped me strengthen my understanding of front-end development.

Today, I built a Study Tracker Dashboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 🎯 This project is designed to help users track their daily learning progress in an organized way. Users can add their subject name, study description, hours spent, and date — all of which get displayed as beautiful, responsive cards. It also includes interactive features like: 🔍 Search bar to quickly find any subject 📅 Sort option to organize study cards vertically or horizontally 💾 Local storage to automatically save data even after refreshing the page On top of the page, the dashboard dynamically updates total subjects, hours studied, and daily goal progress, giving a quick overview of overall performance. I focused on building a clean and professional UI, with a dashboard-style layout, soft color palette, shadows, and smooth user interactions for a modern experience. Each project I complete in this challenge pushes me to think more logically, design better, and understand real-world UI/UX structure. Excited to continue this journey! 💻✨ Mentored by Dhruv Chaturvedi sir hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Frontend hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#CSS hashtag#HTML hashtag#StudyTracker hashtag#100DaysOfCode hashtag#LearningJourney hashtag#CodingChallenge hashtag#DeveloperGrowth 🚀 Day 6/100 of hashtag#100DaysOfProjects Excited to share my personal portfolio website! 💻✨ This project showcases: A modern, responsive design with a circular hero image About Me section with a personal touch Skills section highlighting both technical & creative abilities Interactive and visually engaging UI elements Building this portfolio has been a fun way to blend creativity with code and reflect my growth as a developer. 💡 Next up: more exciting projects in my hashtag#100DaysOfProjects journey! Mentored by Dhruv Chaturvedi sir hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#Portfolio hashtag#FrontendDevelopment hashtag#CodingJourney hashtag#100DaysChallenge Add and change details for these Java While learning Web Development, it does not mean I am losing focus on programming or problem solving. In fact, I am leveling up by choosing the most secure, stable, and widely used language in enterprise solutions—an open source, platform-independent technology. Yes, it’s Java. This week I made tremendous progress. I started by installing JDK and JVM on my system, and set up VS Code for Java. I explored why Java is unique and important, learned what Java offers, and dived into its basic syntax. I broke down every keyword to understand its meaning and role. I went deep into how Java handles compilation and interpretation, as well as JDK, JRE, JIT, JVM, and bytecode. I applied these concepts by writing and running practical code. I strengthened my understanding of programming foundations and OOPS, covering topics like classes, objects, variables, functions, access modifiers, and packages. I also experimented with real use cases for access modifiers—creating objects to access variables and functions from other classes, subclasses, classes in separate files, or even in different packages. Every day brought something new and inspiring. Now, moving forward, I am ready to take on DSA and deeper Java concepts. Thanks to Dhruv Chaturvedi sir for constantly guiding me and not letting me remain limited to my older self.
